<p>Hi my name is Quincy Newman and I am a freshman political science major from Woodbridge, Va. I enjoy playing all sports,especially basketball. My favorite foods are sushi, fried chicken, and tacos. My hobbies include hiking, traveling, and cooking. My goals after college are to become an Army Ranger, and to work for the CIA. That's a little about me!</p>
